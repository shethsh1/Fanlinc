  Our team was formed through our own personal connections, and we initialized a Facebook group as soon as possible to discuss our schedules to see which times would be best to hold an in-person meeting. We managed to all go to the same tutorial each week and to hold our meetings for each week during the sprint demos and also an hour after each tutorial to discuss various issues we encountered. When not meeting in person, our main communication with each other was heavily reliant on Facebook Messenger. During the week when a sprint is due, we would hold our weekly meetings to discuss some of the issues and features that we must improve on from the previous sprints. For example. it was evident that throughout the sprints, our website's appearance was on the weaker side, so we always took note of it and tried to improve the look and feel of the website. We would then spend time to discuss on the new features and tasks that must be accomplished for the next sprint. Any discussion that could not be finished would resume the same night through a Facebook group call. Our team’s communication and openness to one another is our team’s greatest strengths, as we all spoke up if we were not able to finish a task or had trouble understanding the architecture of the project. As for some drawbacks in this team, there were a lot of times that our team would lose focus during meetings, making us not as efficient as we would like, but when everyone is focused, we got things done proficiently. To improve on this in the future, it would be better to find a quieter space to have the meeting since loud noises would distract our focus. We also realized that some of our user stories were too large of a task to accomplish within one sprint and had to be further broken-down during a sprint. This led to more time spent on organizing and dividing the tasks. 
  
  Before starting the project, we consulted with our TA and agreed to use React as our front end. Due to this, we spent a majority of our time familiarizing ourselves with React, since none of the members has been exposed to React prior to the project. As a result, our first sprint was minimal in features and for the rest of the sprint, we were more concerned about getting the features to work rather then making it look good, hence our poor appearance of the website when displaying it to the TA.
  
  If in the future, our team gets back to develop another software, our ideal process would be to have an in person meeting every three days; to have a daily notification on each member’s status and what they’ve accomplished during that day; and to communicate with our client at least once a week to ask for approval and clarifications.
