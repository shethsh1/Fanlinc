## What were the good practices during the sprint?
 * We are very consistant with our Jira commitments this sprint.
 * All backend and features were created on time
 * We created more features this sprint than last sprint


## What were the bad practices during the sprint?
  * We shall not hard code localhost 5000 when we deploy the final website to our client as localhost 5000 is only used in our development stage.
  * Make sure CSS is placed in a separate folder to make it more organized
  * In this sprint, we were not 
  * User REST api properly
  * Need unified authentication for the backend
  * Create one method for POST PUT and GET
  * Pull out the localhost 5000, which was hardcoded. When deploying the website. Node env
  * Create a requirements.txt
  * Make dependencies into a single install command.
  

## How are we going to improve for the next sprint?
  * Our main improvement is going to be trying to make the request more restful and validating variables before sending a request to the flask server
