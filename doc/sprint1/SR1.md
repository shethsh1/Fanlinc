## Unfinished Tasks

* For sprint 1 we have accomplished every task that we set out to do except for the cosmetic design of the profile.

## Best Practices we should continue to do
* We will continue to use Jira to break down tasks and distribute work to each memeber evenly.
* We want to continue our excellence in communication with the Fanlinc clients and within our own group.

## Things to improve on for next sprint
* We want to set bigger SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Timely) goals for our next sprint.
* These new goals will contain more features so that it makes our client happier.

## Harmful practices to stop
* Break up tasks more granularly in order to attain it in a timely manner.
* Due to last weeks mix up in Jira integration, we would want to distribute our Jira subtasks more evenly.
* We also would want to book rooms in advance before our meeting instead of wasting time finding rooms to have our meetings.

## Best/Worst Experiences in Sprint 1
* The best experience we felt in this sprint is how we flawlessly finished all the tasks we set out for with no setbacks.
* The worst experience is Jira tasks being too broad because we did not have enough sub tasks therefore there was a lot of confusion.
* It was also a bad experience for us that our client from Fanlinc is not able to meet up with us during our tutorial time. This causes us to take out time in the week to separately meet up with him.
