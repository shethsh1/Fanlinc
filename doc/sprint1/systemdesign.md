<h1 align="center">Dependencies</h1>



## Dependencies

For back end the dependencies are mysql and Flask and certain imports that can easily be installed through pip


    pip install -U Flask
    pip install pymysql
    pip install -U flask-cors
    pip install -U Flask-SQLAlchemy

For front end we are using node js with react. After install you would just use `npm install` on the front end folder. 

We will assume they have python 3 or above,pip, windows/linux/mac, and node js. Additionally we will assume they have internet.

<h1 align="center">Error-Handling Strategy</h1>



## Error-Handling Strategy

Our error handling strategy for user input is that there will be an error messages sent to the view for invalid inputs. This is so we can tell the user what they are doing that is causing it and what input is needed. We will test many edge cases to ensure we get the correct input.  

In the case of network errors, if its on their part and their internet we will simply give them an error message and let them fix it on their own. If it's on our part, most we can do is give an warning message that the application is experiencing some network error.

In the case of system failures, this is impossible for us to find out so we will simply leave it to the user to reload the page. 

If the rest api will overload in our application we'll give an error message to the user. This is usually cause by the user spaming api request. For example if a user is creating an account and their internet is going slowly while spam clicking register. It would send several requests but it wouldn't cause an issue because emails/usernames are unique on the database.
