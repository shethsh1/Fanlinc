## What were the good practices during the sprint?

* The team was disciplined in showing up for all the important dates we set during the previous sprint.
* Everyone helped each other out on their parts and communicated well with each other during every phase of the sprint.
* Coming from no knowledge of Jira and Github, we learned to work with both of them better as a team.
* We completed our sprint goals.

## What were the bad practices during the sprint?

* Though we learned to use Jira and Github better, we were not consistent in committing our parts during each phase of the sprint.
* During each meeting, our focus wasn’t always shifted towards the main project right away, which lead to longer meetings and late starts.
* We didn’t put enough time into designing our user interface.

## How are we going to improve for the next sprint?

* Essentially improve our Jira tracking by committing distributively throughout the sprint and consistently on Github and Jira.
* During the meetings, we need to be more efficient by dividing the user stories into tasks precisely and assigning them to each member in the group.
* Plan out the next sprint beforehand so we get an early start along with putting in more time into designing our user interface.
