# Team Organization

The way our team was formed was mainly through our own personal connections. Five of us already knew each other and one of us introduced the last two members to finally form our group of seven. We all switched to the same tutorial and we all decided on our team name, STACT. We decided to make a group chat on Facebook to discuss and work on the project for each sprint. Essentially, as of now, all of us decided to serve the same role in this project as it provides flexibility to all of us. It also makes it easier for us to help each other out. However, with that being said, we do plan on having 4 people in the backend and 3 people working on the front end.

# Decision Making
	
After thoroughly reading the sprint 0 handout and what is asked of us, we wanted to split the work where each person would handle one task. The first task, ‘team.md’, took the least time as it required minimal effort from all of us. Excluding that, there were 7 md files in total and conveniently, there were 7 of us as well. This made it easy to distribute the work and we quickly decided during our tutorial who would do what. 

There was a slight dispute amongst us on what project (Fanlinc or Planit) we should tackle. To resolve this, we all got together in a call through our Facebook group chat and resolved that Fanlinc was the best option. 

This group chat ensured that everyone was on the same page when it comes to the project and the decisions that were being made. Briefly put, our team would begin making decisions during our meeting, and if there were any difference of opinions we would have another meeting through online call to settle any issues. We decided to make no major decisions unless there was a consensus between all of us.

# Prioritizing User Stories

For user stories, we used the classic scrum poker to prioritize each user story. Instead of 1-10 we chose to do it with jira's priority scale from lowest to highest. We decided to use this scale to avoid any conflicting priority with Jira had we used another one. For quantifying complexity, we saw it best fit to use the Fibonacci sequence.

# Meetings

The team met every week after our tutorial to discuss the project. If a person wouldn’t be able to make it, they would notify the group chat an hour prior so we can reschedule an online group meeting later on in the day. This way no one was excluded from any information at all for any meeting.

# Next Phase

A lesson we plan to take forward to the next phase is to settle all differences of opinions as earliest as possible. We also plan to prepare more individually for each meeting, in ways such as reading the handout beforehand, coming up with ideas and presenting it to team members. Another lesson we plan to take forward is to help each other out as much as we can as we are all a team. While we embrace the idea of bringing individual ideas, we also need to work as a team and work towards consensus’ in decisions more than democratic decisions.
