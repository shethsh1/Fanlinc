### Project Objective: 
- Our objective is to build a user-friendly software that is used as a platform to bring fans of all types together.

- It is in our interest to build a community based platform that allows users to connect with other fans via posts, chats, and events within the fandom website.



### Key Users:
- General Fan

- Cosplayer

- Vendor


### Key Scenarios:
**Scenario 1 - General Fan:**  A Raptors fan wants to stay updated with the teams off-season moves such as trades, free agency and signings.

- Using a username and password to log into Fanlinc (or register for one)

- Adds Toronto Raptors fandom to his profile

- Navigates to the News/Events sections of the Raptors fandom to view any recent activities

**Scenario 2 - Cosplayer:** A League of Legends streamer is a cosplayer and is attending Twitchcon this year. They are going to be setting up a booth to sign autographs and sell their merch.

- Signs into Fanlinc

- Navigates to their fandom to make a post advertising their booth at an event where they will be selling merch and signing autographs


**Scenario 3 - Vendor:** Anthony was recently at a Sneakercon, where he won signed Travis Scott Air Jordan 1â€™s. He is not a big fan of the shoes and feels he's better off selling them to a Travis Scott fan who would appreciate them more.

- Sign in with account information 

- Search for a Travis Scott fandom page

- Puts in profile that he is a vendor

- Makes a post to see if anybody is interested in the shoes


 
### Key Principles:
- From a consumer point of view, this software allows users to connect with fans of all types through fandoms 

- From a Vendor/Artists point of view, it allows them to connect with their fans, set up events and stay updated

- For a general user, it gives them a platform to make friends, stay connected with their interests, and socialize.
