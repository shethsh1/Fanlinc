# Product Backlog

## Numerical Series

For this project we will be using the jira scale to prioritize each user story. The priorities are ranked from highest, high, medium, low, and lowest.

To denote the stages of difficulty of each user stories, we will be using the fibanocci sequence running from 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, and 89.
Zero (0) will be the lowest complexity and eighty-nine (89) will be the highest complexity for the user stories.
