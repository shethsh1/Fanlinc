### Comments
- Of the "features" outlined on JIRA, they do seem to be completed and are working fine.
- Some of the "features" completed this sprint are a little lacklustre and some components appear to be drawn out.
  - E.G. changing your profile picture and changing your display name do not count as two different features; they are two components of the same feature
- It didn't feel like there were a lot of features done this sprint.
  - Aim to increase your workload for the later sprints.
  - Be weary of falling behind as a result of doing too little work each sprint.
