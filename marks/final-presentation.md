    - was fine
    - one of the more engaging introductions; good job
- profile functionality                                                                                             (3/3)
    - login and registration works
    - can edit some profile information
- viewing fandoms                                                                                                   (3/3)
    - can create and view fandoms
    - can delete fandoms
    - some of the UI could use a little more work (if you guys had more time)
        - like how the theme is generally unified; things generally look like they fit together
        - some of the layout is fine but some looks like it isn't really fleshed out
            - e.g. some of your pages have all the forms going down vertically
                - on the other hand, forms like your profile login page are formatted nicer
- interacting with fandoms                                                                                          (3/3)
    - can join fandoms
    - can post to fandoms
    - generally does what it's supposed to
